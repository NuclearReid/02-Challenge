## Purpose of this project

This project was to practice at cleaning a website's HTML, and CSS source code.
* Semantic HTML elements were added to the code/replaced less intutive element naming
* alt attributes were added to the images used on the website
* The CSS code has been cleaned and consildated to be easier to follow
* comments have been added to both [style.css](./Assets/css/style.css) and [index.html](index.html)
* Non-functioning links have been fixed

### Semantic elements changed/added <a name="semantic-html-changes"></a>
* changed \<div\> tags to \<article\> and \<section\> tags to the horizontal tiles
* included tags for the \<aside\> and \<sections\>
* Added a \<header\> tag
* Added a \<main\> tag
* Added a \<footer\> tag
* adjursted the \<h\> tags to follow the flow of correct order of content for of the landing page


### HTML accessability 
With the use of Wave Web Accessibility Evalutation Tool ([wave](https://wave.webaim.org/)) I have located and corrected ambiguous tags within the index.html

With the intention of leaving the overal design of the page the same as I recieved it, I have ignored the 'contrast errors'.
